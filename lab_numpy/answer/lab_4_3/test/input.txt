brandy is a software engineer
facebook
and alongside
a team of other facebookers
he
spent the
last two years
rebuilding the system
that removes spam malicious
offensive
or otherwise
unwanted messages
from the
largest social network
no small task
facebook juggles
messages from
more than
billion people worldwide
and to tackle the problem
brandy and team
made
an
unusual choice
they used a
programming language called haskell
in the
early
committee
of academics
built
haskell
as a kind of experiment
in language design
and all these years
later it remains on the fringe
of mainstream programming
primary repository
for software code
on the
net haskell
ranks
on the list
of the most
popular languages
even so
facebook chose it as the
basis for its
enormously complex
anti spam system
